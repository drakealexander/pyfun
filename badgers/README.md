# [⏪ Badgers, Badgers, Badgers](/README.md)

In this lesson you learn how to teach your program to count and 
repeat stuff for a specific number of times.

## [⏫ The Usual](#)

You [know what to do](/hello/README.md). Create a script and have
it print something just to make sure everything is setup correctly
before we continue.

Let’s take a look. Can you count them?

[![](/assets/badgers.gif)](https://youtu.be/EIyixC9NsLI)

Ok, so there are 12 of them, 2 mushrooms, and a snake:

* repeat 3 times:
  * 12 badgers
  * 2 mushrooms
* 12 badgers
* 1 snake
* repeat 4 times:
  * 12 badgers
  * 2 mushrooms
* 12 badgers
* 1 snake
* 12 badgers
* 2 mushrooms

These verses of the “song” will be our simple algorithm. Let’s code it
and learn about ***finite loops*** in the process. These loops only
repeat for a certain number of times.

### [⏫ How Long is True, True?](#)

Duh, forever right. Yeah that is a long time. That is ***infinite***.
It never ends. There are other things that are infinite as well, like
`1 == 1`, `2 + 2 == 4`

### [⏫ Everything Must Come to an End](#)

Stuff that has an ending is ***finite***, like our lives, our program,
and each verse of the song. Things that are ***finite*** can be
measured and counted. This is what we will do in this program.

## [⏫ Teaching Our Program to Count](#)

Between us, computers are, as Lord Gabe Newel (of Valve) says,
“possibly the stupidest thing in the entire universe.”

*(Thanks again to Code.org for the video.)*

It is not rude or incorrect to say that a computer knows *nothing*
unless we teach it. In order to have our program stop after a certain
number of repeated verses we first have to teach it to count.

###

> 💬 We already learned how to make our program remember stuff with
> *variables* in [Hi](/hi/README.md).

Let’s start by making our program remember a single number we will
call `count`. We will put the number 0 in it.

```python
count = 0
print(count)
```

So far we are not doing anything with it. We just print it to make
sure our program is remembering `count` correctly.

Now 


## [⏫ Conclusion](#)

Could the Badgers have taught us a lot about the nature of the
Universe? Perhaps, but mostly they taught us how to teach our programs
to count and do things after counting to certain numbers.

> 🍎 Do not confuse finite counting loops with list iteration, which we
> cover later.
